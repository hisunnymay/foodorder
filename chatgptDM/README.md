# Food ordering using ChatGPT as dispatcher

This is a case study where we attempt to use ChatGPT as dialog management to build a food order chatbot. This is based on the wonderful course on Prompt Engineering on deeplearning.ai, which is a great starting point on prompt engineering. 

 ## Before you start
This package will rely on openai python package, which you can install via pip. We assume that you are using python3 with version 3.10+.

pip install openai

Another thing, before you start, you will also an openai api key, which you can get from:
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

And make sure you have credit left for generate tokens.

## run this:
python3 foodorder.py
